Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the use of engineering principles and methods to develop and maintain software systems. software engeering is important in development of high quality software systems and applications. software engineering ensures production quality and realible software within a minimized budget and time. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 Milestones include the development of programming languages.
 the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
 the advent of structured programming in the 1970s
 the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. 



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements-this the phase where the needs of the user are gathered and documented.
designing- this is where the software structure and architectural design is designed.
development/implementation- this is where coding and development of  the software is done.
testing- the developed software is  run through several tests to ensure it meets quality assurance standards
deployment- launching or releasing the software to the user.
maintenance- involves  occasional updates and enhancement after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer- writes code and dvelops the software
 quality assurance-runs tests on the developed software to ensre that it meets quality assurance standards
 project manager- oversees planning, execution,and delivery of the software. 
 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is crafting questions or instrutions so as to get the best responses from A.I. Prompt engineering is important so as to avoid getting vague or complicated feedback from A.I models. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague question- tell me about dogs 
clear,specific and concise question- tell me about german shepherd dogs 
the improved prompt is more effective because it is asking information about specific breed of dogs rather than all dogs in general.
